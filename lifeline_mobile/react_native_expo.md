React Native with Expo is a powerful framework for building cross-platform mobile apps using JavaScript or TypeScript. Expo provides a set of tools and services that streamline development, testing, and deployment of React Native apps.

Here are the key features of React Native Expo:

Cross-Platform Development:
  Write once, run on iOS, Android, and Web.
  Consistent APIs across platforms.

Managed Workflow:
  No need to touch native code (e.g., Java, Swift) unless you choose the Bare workflow.
  Everything runs out of the box, including camera, location, and push notifications.

Pre-built SDK:
  Expo SDK includes over 50+ native APIs:
  Camera
  Location
  Notifications
  Accelerometer
  Barcode scanner
  File system
  Haptics
Sensors API::
  Accelerometer,
  Barometer,
  DeviceMotion,
  Gyroscope,
  LightSensor,
  Magnetometer,
  MagnetometerUncalibrated,
  Pedometer

Expo Go App:
Test apps instantly on your phone using the Expo Go app (available on iOS and Android).
Live reload and fast refresh built-in.

Fast Iteration:
Hot Reloading and Fast Refresh let you see changes in real-time.
No need to recompile or re-deploy every time.

Over-the-Air (OTA) Updates:
Push updates to users without going through the App Store or Play Store review process.
Update your appâ€™s JS/Assets instantly.

Development Tools
Expo CLI: Command-line tool to build, run, and publish your apps.
Expo DevTools: Web-based GUI for debugging and project management.
Snack: Online code editor to test and share React Native code without installing anything.

EAS (Expo Application Services)
EAS Build: Cloud-based builds for iOS and Android (even for apps with custom native code).
EAS Submit: Submit builds directly to App Store and Google Play.
EAS Update: Push JS/Asset changes without a new build.

Authentication Support
Integrates with Firebase, Auth0, Google, Facebook, Apple, and others.
SecureStorage, Keychain access, etc.

Bare Workflow Support
Need custom native code? Eject to Bare workflow and use regular React Native tooling.
Still compatible with many Expo tools and APIs.

Great Documentation & Community
Official docs: https://docs.expo.dev

Large and active community.
Tons of tutorials, libraries, and plugins.
